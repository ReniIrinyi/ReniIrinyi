### Hi there ğŸ‘‹  iÂ´m Reni,

- ğŸ‘¯ I'm a Junior Software Developer and currently doing an internship as a Full Stack Developer at Vizavy GmbH. During my studies, my main focus was on Java, SpringBoot and Angular, and these are the languages/frameworks I use most in my current work.
- ğŸ”­ I like to learn and try new things, and my private projects are a great way to do that. 
- ğŸ˜„ I mostly like working with Angular, TypeScript and Node.js. 
- ğŸ’¬ You can contact me in German, English or Hungarian
