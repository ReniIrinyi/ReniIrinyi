and how much I've learned and implemented. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React. 
- ğŸ˜„ I really enjoy problem solving as it gives me great satisfaction when I find a solution to a complex problem.
- ğŸ‘¯ I am very enthusiastic about coding and I want to work with
people who are equally passionate about it!
