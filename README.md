### Hi there 👋  i´m Reni,
- 🔭 I started learning JavaScript only a few months ago and now I'm very proud of my progress 
and how much I've learned and implemented. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Html, and CSS
- 😄 I really enjoy problem solving as it gives me great satisfaction when I find a solution to a complex problem.
- 👯 I am very excited about coding and I want to work with
people who are equally passionate about this discipline!
- 💬 You can contact me in German, English or even Hungarian
